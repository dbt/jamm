Building instructions
---------------------

  To build Jamm, you need to have the following installed:

    * Java 1.3.x or Java 1.4.x
      http://java.sun.com/

    * The Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 APIs
      http://java.sun.com/

    * XDoclet version 1.1
      http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/

    * Log4j version 1.1.3
      http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/

    * Cryptix version 3.2.0
      http://www.cryptix.org/

    * Checkstyle version 2.2
      http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/

    * Struts version 1.1-b1 or better
      http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/

    * Ant version 1.4.1
      http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

  Once all that is installed, you need to create a local
  build.properties file to tell ant the location of the various
  libraries.  To do this, copy src/build.properties to the top level
  directory and uncomment and edit the lines for each library.

  Once that is done, you can build the war file by typing:

    % ant dist

  The war file will be created in the dist directory.

  If you need to clean it up

    % ant clean


Installing Jamm
---------------

  OpenLDAP
  --------

  Put jamm.schema in your schema directory and make sure that its
  included in the slapd.conf.  Then create an ldif file to lay down
  the basic structure of the top level and the Manager.  Use ldapadd
  to add them to LDAP, and you should be ready to start using JAMM.

  The web parts
  -------------
  To install Jamm, unjar the war file in the directory you would like
  to deploy to.  Do not simply just drop the war file there as you
  need to do some configuration first.

  Once its unjared, go into the WEB-INF directory.  Copy
  jamm.properties.dist to jamm.properties and edit it so it has that
  it matches the configuration for your site.

  At this point you should be good to go.  You may need to restart your
  servlet container, check with your server documentation.
