Building instructions
---------------------

  To build Jamm, you need to have the following installed:

    * Java 1.3.x  (There are some problems we ran into with 1.4, so we're
                   sticking with 1.3 until we figure them out.)

    * The Servlet and JSP APIs

    * XDoclet version 1.1
      http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/

    * Log4j version 1.1.3
      http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/

    * Cryptix version 3.2.0
      http://www.cryptix.org/

    * Checkstyle version 2.1
      http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/

    * Struts version 1.1-b1 or better
      http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/

    * Ant version 1.4.1

  Once all that is installed you can build the war file by typing:

    # ant dist

  If you need to clean it up

    # ant clean
