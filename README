The Java Mail Manager (Jamm) is a package for managing virtual mail
aliases and accounts. It has multiple levels of access from user to
domain administrator to site administrator. Jamm comes with an LDAP
schema that it follows. Unlike simliar projects, Jamm only modifies
what is in LDAP and leaves some of the "aftermath" file cleanup to the
administrator.
