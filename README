The Java Mail Manager (Jamm) is a package for managing virtual mail
aliases and accounts. It has multiple levels of access from user to
domain administrator to site administrator. Jamm comes with an LDAP
schema that it follows. Unlike similar projects, Jamm only modifies
what is in LDAP and leaves some of the "aftermath" file cleanup to the
administrator and/or helper scripts.

Look at INSTALL for build and install instructions.

Please also read UPGRADE if you are upgrading Jamm from 0.9.2 or
earlier.

Other Important Files
---------------------

* src/schema/jamm.schema

  This is the LDAP schema that Jamm expects to follow.  For an example
  of a LDIF file following this schema, look at
  doc/samples/sample.ldif


How to use jammCleaner
----------------------
Usage:  JammCleaner [options]
 -?,--help           prints help message
 -B,--backups arg    back up account contents to this directory before deleting
 -D,--dn arg         the dn to bind with
 -b,--base arg       base dn to search from
 -h arg              ldap host  (default: localhost)
 -n,--no-execute     Print would be executed, but do not execute.
 -p arg              ldap port  (default: 389)
 -v,--verbose        verbose
 -w,--password arg   password to connect to LDAP with
 -y,--yes            Assume yes for all questions

JammCleaner can be run out of cron or run manually.  It is designed to
be run as the vmail user, it does not need root privileges to get its
job done.

If the -y flag is passed, it will assume yes to all questions it would
normally ask the user.  This flag is to be used for along with cron.
Without the -y flag, jammCleaner will ask before removing any files
and removing the entry from ldap.

A typical invocation for running in cron would look like:
  # jammCleaner -b "o=hosting,dc=kgarner,dc=com" \
     -D "cn=Manager,dc=kgarner,dc=com" -w managerpassword -y 

Please note, that in jamm 0.9.3 the -B option is not yet implemented.
