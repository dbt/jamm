  For 1.0:

    * User feedback after actions using html:messages.

	* Filter DomainAdmin by first letter

  Not sure when:

    * Generate passwords for accounts and/or aliases
      Port diceware to Java?

    * Send e-mail after account creation to assure creation of user directory

    * A configurable limit of the number of accounts/aliases a domain
      can have.

    * Quota editor?

    * Let root change where postmaster@domain mail goes to.

  Post 1.0:

    * Have an account from one domain be a postmaster for multiple domains
      - Backend supports this, must be built into webapp

Bugs to be fixed:
    * When a domain is set to be deleted, its catchall is still
      active.  Must set to inactive or set delete flag.
      -- half done
